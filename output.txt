### Current Positions Management:

1. **Ticker**: NVDA
   - **Action**: HOLD
   - **Quantity**: 0.75 shares
   - **Take Profit (TP)**: $189.99
   - **Stop Loss (SL)**: $175.00
   - **Rationale**: NVDA's substantial price increase of 3.93% suggests strong momentum. With no news suggesting an imminent decline, it is prudent to hold, but with a stop loss at $175.00 to manage potential downside.

2. **Ticker**: AVGO
   - **Action**: HOLD
   - **Quantity**: 10 shares
   - **Take Profit (TP)**: $356.00
   - **Stop Loss (SL)**: $330.00
   - **Rationale**: AVGO is showing a healthy upward momentum with a 3.18% price increase. Without new developments, maintaining the position with adjusted profit-taking measures allows room for continued gains while minimizing losses.

3. **Ticker**: BEAT
   - **Action**: CLOSE
   - **Quantity**: 3 shares
   - **Rationale**: With a sharp 14.39% increase in its recent price, taking advantage of the growth spurt and closing the position secures realized profits. With no recent news to justify such a surge, there is a higher risk of a pullback.

### New Trade Recommendations:

1. **Ticker**: AMD
   - **Action**: BUY
   - **Quantity**: Approximately 4.68 shares ($1,000 risk).
   - **Take Profit (TP)**: $230.00
   - **Stop Loss (SL)**: $200.00
   - **Rationale**: AMD has shown a significant 6.15% increase, indicating strong current momentum. This makes it a favorable purchase with a calculated risk-to-reward ratio. The SL is set close to recent support levels to manage potential reversals.

2. **Ticker**: MSTR
   - **Action**: BUY
   - **Quantity**: Approximately 6.06 shares ($1,000 risk).
   - **Take Profit (TP)**: $175.00
   - **Stop Loss (SL)**: $160.00
   - **Rationale**: MSTR has experienced a 4.16% surge, suggesting robust market sentiment possibly linked to cryptocurrency trends given its exposure to Bitcoin. A strategic near-term buy with clear TP and SL levels is advisable to exploit this movement.

These strategies balance the current market dynamics with a focus on maintaining a diversified and responsive trading posture.
